                    When I said Myanmar, the first thing I saw was Bagan, one of the world heritage sites. It is a
                    region where Buddhism, the country's main religion, flourished. That's why I went to Bagan first.
                    When I arrived Bagan, the smell of delicious food attracted me. Even though I ate on the plane, I
                    felt hungry.
                    But I just went to the hotel because I was very tired. The next day, I decided to look around Bagan.
                    I went there first because Ananda Buddha is famous. When I arrived there, I felt peace, the sound of
                    the wind, Everything was silent except the sound of birds.
                    After visiting the temple for over an hour, I got hungry, so I decided to go back to the hotel. On
                    the way back to the hotel, when I first arrived in Bagan, I got another tasteful smell. Because of
                    that smell, I can't control my appetite anymore. Since I am a Food rampant from the beginning, I
                    started eating a lot of Hta-min-thote.

                After eating the food from Bagan, I was very full. So I decided to go for a walk.
                The pagodas of Bagan always give me peace.
                After visiting one pagoda after another, I wanted to know more about Bagan's history, so I hired a
                guide who knows Bagan's history well.
                He told me that Bagan is a World Heritage Site (UNESCO).

                He started talking about King Anoratha, the founder of Bagan.
                I was interested in the history of Bagan and didn't even notice that it was getting late.
                That's why I went back to the hotel to listen to the rest the next day.
                After visiting a lot, I can't do anything when I got to the hotel.
                After dinner, I went to sleep.

                When I arrived the next morning, my stomach hurt a lot, so I went to the
                doctor and he said this happened cause I ate a lot of spicy food.
                And he is not wrong with it.
                The next day, my stomach was still not feeling well, but I couldn't take another day off, so today I
                went to
                a nearby village.
                The village is not far from the hotel, and we arrived in a short time. As soon as he reached the
                village,
                the children of the village came running.
                I was startled as to why, and then someone who spoke English asked me, They said that when foreigners
                come,
                they rush like that.
                It was almost evening when I arrived, so I decided to stay at the old man's house for the night.
                The next day is the day I will say goodbye to this place.
                I am sure that I will come to this place again.
