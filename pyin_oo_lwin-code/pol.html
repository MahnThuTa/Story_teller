                    Now, I will be heading to our last trip, which is PyinOoLwin.
                    The history of Pyin Oo Lwin dates back to the pre-colonial period with the establishment of a
                    military outpost near a small village between Lashio and Mandalay, in the Shan Hills. After Myanmar
                    was taken over by the British, the town was converted into a permanent military post in 1897.
                    Coincidentally, there's a flower festival going on when I arrive. The place is populated with a big
                    crowd. I rested for half an hour at a place with a breathtaking point of view. After that,
                    surprisingly, I started cruising around with a coach, and had fun talking with the coach driver. He
                    said that in PyinOoLwin, there're six beautiful waterfalls. They are Anisakan Waterfall, Hampshire
                    Waterfall, Nat Kyone Waterfall, Yay Pyan Taung Waterfall, Dee Doke Waterfall and December Farm
                    Waterfall.

                First, I went to the most popular garden in Pyin Oo Lwin. It's populated with crowds and flowers are
                breathtaking. And then, at the middle of the lake, there's the name "Pyin Oo Lwin"
                that's created with flowers. These flowers are gorgeous, just like "her", and it made me forget to
                breathe for a brief moment.
                Now, it's noon. So I'm hungry but I'm having trouble with how to order food. Luckily, I met with a
                guy with a great English speaking skill in public. I asked him and he pointed to a nearby Cafe. And
                he said coffee from that shop is great and so are snacks. So I went there and took a rest. And then,
                I started heading to the waterfall which the coach driver told me about, The Anisakan Waterfall,
                it's the must visit place for me.
                Dat Taw Gyaint Waterfall, also commonly known as Anisakan Falls, is a magical waterfall with a blue,
                natural, and refreshing swimming hole.
                I took the view there.And once I get back the same day, I won't stop.

                I've been wanting to go to Phachin Myung Cave for a long time. But I didn't know where it was, so I
                asked a
                nearby resident.
                "Maha Nandamu Peik Chin Myaung Cave is located near Nung Pein Village, north of Pyin Oo Lwin town, near
                Mandalay-Muse road. It is about 12 miles from Pyin Oo Lwin town, 2 miles south of Bewwan village."
                Next, when I wanted to know why it was called Peik Chin Myaung, I asked at once.
                He said, "In front of the cave, there were many medicinal gypsy plants growing thickly, so it was called
                Peik Chin Myaung." So I went to the direction he said by taxi. By the way there's been no one who hasn't
                helped me since I arrived. Burmese have a good attitude. When I arrived at Peik Chin Myaung, I saw the
                group
                of people playing water in front of the cave, so I join with them.
                As they were splashing water at me, my shirt became wet. So i bought Knitted sweaters to wear and i also
                bought wines, strawberry jams and various fresh fruits ​at the local produce shop on my way to hotel.
                It's getting late in the evening, so it's time to say goodbye. I was very happy to visit
                Pyin Oo Lwin, and I hope to visit again next time.
