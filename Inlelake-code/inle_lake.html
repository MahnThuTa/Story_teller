                    Bagan is very pleasant. So I went on to the place I really wanted to go to. That place is a very
                    wide and beautiful Inle. Ever since I heard about Inle, I really wanted to go. I'm going now, so I
                    can't wait.It is very beautiful as the saying
                    "ngway sain hpyauu layy hkainn htarr salo satinnsakarr so lout taal".The sun was shining on the lake
                    and the lake water was like silver. It was breathtaking. I was very tired when I arrived, so I
                    rested at the hotel I had booked online.The room I took was a floating hotel in Inle Lake. I can
                    fully see the floating farms and floating markets. The scenery is very beautiful, and the most
                    beautiful of them is rowing the boat with foot. Rowing a boat with foot is a traditional act of
                    Inlay that is nowhere to be seen.
                    After resting for a while, I got hungry, so I decided to eat. There were a lot of dishes in the
                    inle. Among them, I ordered the Shan noodles, nga htamin , tofu warm , wark thar chin , hinn hote ,
                    and inn mote te which were I really wanted to eat.I ate while looking at the view of Inle Lake and
                    the floating plantations.

                I ate a lot, but I have to eat fully when i am here,I was able to eat
                dinner late. I arrived late in the evening, so I spent the night at the hotel. Waking up the next
                morning, I wanted to try the food that I haven't tried yet. So I ate khaw pote , htamin jin and
                coconut milk jelly. My stomach was full, so I decided to visit.
                I rented a boat because I wanted to ride a boat when I arrive inle. I went to Phong Tao U Pagoda first,
                then
                I went to the rest of the temples, such as Nga Phe Kyaung Monastery, and Shwe Intin Pagoda. Of course,
                How
                could I forget the Ywarma Floating Market, so I visited the Ywarma Floating Market and saw selling with
                boats beautifully.

                A day passed like that, and this time, instead of staying at a hotel, I stayed with a very friendly
                family.
                I woke up and I was hungry, so I decided to eat at Family Restaurant.I've had enough to eat, so let's
                continue our journey. So I went to the places I wanted to visit. first I watched the puppet show. I took
                pictures of many beautiful places and sat quietly watching the gorgeous sunset.
                And I wanted to buy a gift for my parents on my way home. I bought some inle souvenir handicraft , a lot
                of
                pasoes that made of cotton , some silk longyi, some inle souvenir shirts, and a very beautiful necklace.
                So, the time has come to say good-bye to Inle, and the journey has come to an end. But let's keep
                watching
                Pyin Oo Lwin trip, to the next destination...
